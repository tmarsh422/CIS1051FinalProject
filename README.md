I'd say the greatest challenge for me in doing this project was the nested indexing, as that isn't something we covered in class but was instead something I had to learn with the Runestone online textbook. Specifically I used chapter 17.7. Trying to complete this project was a nightmare without being about to extract the nested data, because the matrix was made using lists inside a list in order to define the dimensions of the matrix. This was also the biggest thing I learned doing this project next to learning to work with pygame.

Despite the difficulties of the assignment, I really enjoyed it and have a lot of satisfaction in being able to do what I did. I initially wanted to make the game fully interactable but I wasn't able to achieve that with the knowledge and resources I had. Specifically, being able to interact in a pygame window with a mouse was not something I was able to figure out using the textbook, pygame's official website, or the Mario/Pong examples that were given, so I hit a definite roadblock there I believe. 

However, now that the project is submitted, I'll definitely continue working on it during winter break in order to finish it and make something that is fully playable. I dont want to copy other people's code, but I will be able to have the freedom of simply looking up how to interact in a pygame window with a mouse in order to continue with the game.

I mention it in the video but I also used a less intuitive method of drawing the Sudoku grid, using rectangles instead of lines. I'm not sure why rectangles worked for me first, but they did, and the effect was the same either way so I decided to just use rectangles overlapping with eachother. That was a minor example of using creativity in a way that wasnt initially intended in order to complete the assignment.

Overall, I really enjoyed this class and wish I had discovered coding before my senior year, but this is definitely something I want to pursue now in the future. I'm excited to see what else I can create with python.
